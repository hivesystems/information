## Navigation

[ViaHive](https://github.com/xenforq/HiveClient/tree/master/ViaHive):

ViaHive is our take at a connection client that allows its users to connect to servers between versions b1.6.4 to 1.8.8. It is relatively well-maintained and is one of our core selling points.

[Hive Client](https://github.com/xenforq/HiveClient/tree/master/Hive%20Client):

Hive Client is a feature rich hacked client for Minecraft that allows our users to play on multiple servers without being detected by their anti-cheat. Additionally, Hive Client is well-maintained and contains multiple bypasses.

[Branding Package](https://github.com/xenforq/HiveClient/tree/master/Branding%20Package):

Our Branding Package contains, well, our branding. Branding Guidelines, Logos, Icons, and Logomarks. Project files cannot be found in there; those have to be requested personally via [xenforq](https://twitter.com/XenForq).
